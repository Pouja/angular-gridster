fork of ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster

Things I changed:
 * Added isValidMove, so you can verify if the item that has moved is a valid move.
 * Added the fix for [issue 230](https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster/issues/230)
 * Multi-Gridster, the ability to move gridster items from one gridster to another, see the demo how to use it.
